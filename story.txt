Once upon a time there was a semi professional basketball team named the Tropics. The Tropics were once a great franchise that used to sell out every seat in thier stadium. The team and city of flint was flourishing until the pop artist Jackie Moon, best known for his hit song "Love Me Sexy", purchased the team at its peak. Jackie ran the team and franchise into the ground by forcing himself into rolls of owner, manager, coach, player and promotor. With hopes of bringing his franchise back from the dead, Jackie heads to a league owners meeting with hopes of merging into the NBA.
