Once upon a time there was a semi professional basketball team named the Tropics. The Tropics were once a great franchise that used to sell out every seat in thier stadium. The team and city of flint was flourishing until the pop artist Jackie Moon, best known for his hit song "Love Me Sexy", purchased the team at its peak. Jackie ran the team and franchise into the ground by forcing himself into rolls of owner, manager, coach, player and promotor. With hopes of bringing his franchise back from the dead, Jackie heads to a league owners meeting with hopes of merging into the NBA.
Sadly, the NBA team haven't watched the movie in a number of years and forgot how the story developed. They instead thought the tropics were some cheer squad so they decided to invite them all over for a "tryout". The day came, the tropics were all ready. They did their routine and the NBA loved it! The NBA decided they would become the Harlem Globetrotters.
