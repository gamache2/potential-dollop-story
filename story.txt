Once upon a time there was a semi professional basketball team named the Tropics. The Tropics were once a great franchise that used to sell out every seat in thier stadium. The team and city of flint was flourishing until the pop artist Jackie Moon, best known for his hit song "Love Me Sexy", purchased the team at its peak. Jackie ran the team and franchise into the ground by forcing himself into rolls of owner, manager, coach, player and promotor. With hopes of bringing his franchise back from the dead, Jackie heads to a league owners meeting with hopes of merging into the NBA.
Sadly, the NBA team haven't watched the movie in a number of years and forgot how the story developed. They instead thought the tropics were some cheer squad so they decided to invite them all over for a "tryout". The day came, the tropics were all ready. They did their routine and the NBA loved it! The NBA decided they would become the Harlem Globetrotters.
	The Globetrotter's first season started off rough. At first fans were confused on who this new team was. Team morale was low, which translated to bad basketball on the court. After losing every single game for the first 10 games of the season, the Globetrotters needed a new strategy. Jackie Moon (The team's owner and artists of hit song "Love Me Sexy"),used his negotiating skills to negotiate Shaq out of retirement and onto the Globetrotter's. Now with Shaq leading the team, the Globetrotter's were unstoppable and went on the NBA's longest winning streak in history.
	Jackie Moon was no longer a one hit wonder. Now with the stardom of having the best baseketball team to ever touch a ball, Jackie was happy. He then settled down, got married and had two wonderful children, Kobe and Bryant.
